1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
A) True and False

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
A) and, or, not

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
A) 
First Bool value        Second bool value     and operator        or operator         
True                      True                  True                True                
True                      False                 False               True      
False                     True                  False               True
False                     False                 False               False 

Bool value          not operator
True                  False
False                 True

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) -> False
not (5 > 4)  ->  False 
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) -> True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))  -> True
(True and True) and (True == False)  -> False
(not False) or (not True)  -> True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
A) ==, >= , <=, !=, <, >  

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
A) equal to = "==" , assignment operator = "=",

While we compare the values we use "==", for assigning we use "=". 

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
  print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
  print('bacon')
else:
  print('ham')
  print('spam')
  print('spam')


8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
A) 
if spam == 1:
  print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
  print('Howdy')
else:
  print('Greetings!')

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Ctrl + C

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Break will bring the control out of loop and where as continue will only break the current iteration and continue with other.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
A) All will print the numbers till 10, range (10) -> prints 10 numbers (0 - 9),
range (0,10) -> prints numbers from 0 to 10, with 0 as start and end as 10.
range (0,10,1) -> prints numbers from 1 to 10 with step 1.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
A) 
for i in range(1, 11):
    print (i)

i=1;
while i<=10:
    print(i)
    i = i+1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
A) 
import spam

  spam.bacon()
